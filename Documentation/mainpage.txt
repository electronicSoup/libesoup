<p>
The electronicSoup library contains source code for, at present, a limited number of
Microchip devices. The library was developed to facilitate faster development
of higher level application code for the cinnamonBun series of devices. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
PIC18F2585/2680/4585/4680
</li>
<li>
PIC24FJ256GB110 Family
</li>
<li>
dsPIC33EPXXX(GP/MC/MU)806/810/814
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where to start?</h2>

<p>
The library is still in a state of flux as it's still under
development. Having said that the main structure of the code should
not change. There is however an open question with regard to the order
of header file inclusion. The problem is that some definitions
depend upon target micro-controller definitions and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
An example of this issue is that where Hardware allows the code allows
the configuration of a 3 pin serial logging header to define the
functionality of the 3 pins. The Ground pin is fixed but the remaining
two pins can either be in the order Rx/Tx and the alternative
Tx/Rx. This order has to be defined before the Hardware headers are
included so that the correct pin definitions can be included in the
compiled code.
</p>

<p>
Similar to how the Linux Kernel is configured by the
<em>.config.h</em> header file the electronicSoup Library is configure
with a configuration file <em>libesoup_config.h</em>. The name is
slightly less catchy then its Linux equivilent, but it should not
clash with any other headers which may be used in the future.
