 * must have this ability enabled. If a single node does not comply with this
 * Protocol it will be left behind, on the old Baud Rate, and will effectively 
 * broadcast noise on the network.
 *
 * Functionality: If this mechanism is invoked a series of 3 count down messages
 * are broadcast on the network. Each message contains a countdown timer and 
 * the new Buad rate to be used by the network. The new baud rate is specified
 * as a member of the can_baud_rate_t enumerated type (can/es_can.h). So the series
 * of countdown messages are, in the case of moving to baud_250K:
 *
 * 3 Seconds, baud_250K
 * 2 Seconds, baud_250K
 * 1 Second,  baud_250K
 *
 * When a node receives the message it starts a timer for the specified duration.
 * If the node misses the following two countdown messages it will still change
 * to the new Baud rate regardless. 
 * 
 * When one of the following countdown messages is received the existing timer
 * is canceled and re-started with the new countdown timer value.
 *
 * It is extremely unlikely that a node should miss All three countdown 
 * messages. If a node misses all three then Baud rate is the least of your 
 * worries.
 *
 * Once the timer finally expires the node disconnects from the CAN Node, 
 * changes its Baud rate and waits for 10 Seconds before rejoining the Network.
 * If all nodes comply with the DCNCP Baud Rate Protocol the network will now
 * be operating at the new network Baud Rate.

/**
 * @brief Include ISO15765 Functionality
 *
 * ISO15765 has a dependance on random! Add es_lib/utils/rand.c to your project 
 * and, to initialise a seed, on startup call:
 * 
 * init_rand();
 *
 * ISO15765 defines a Layer 3 Protocol which sits on top of the CAN Bus,
 * Later 2, protocol. CAN Bus transmits frames with up to 8 Bytes of Data. That
 * is perfect in a field bus where status data is being send across the network.
 * However depending on your applicaiton 8 bytes of data can be a limiting
 * factor. The ISO15765 protocol adds the ability to send larger messages
 * across the Bus. The larger messages are segmented into short frames for 
 * transmission across the bus and reassembly on the other side.
 *
 * The es_lib implementation of ISO15765 is not a strict implementation of the
 * standard. For example the standard enables a maximum message size for 
 * transmission of 4095 Bytes whilst es_lib defines ISO15765_MAX_MSG as 270
 * in es_lib/core.h. Seperate from this size is a Protocol or Layer 3 message
 * type. The es_lib implementation defines the first byte of the transmitted
 * message as a Protocol Identifier which specifies the type of the message.
 *
 * The es_lib CAN implementation reserves two ISO15765 Protocol ID's for
 * specific use in es_lib/can/es_can.h:
 * 
 * #define ISO15765_LOGGER_PROTOCOL_ID    0x01
 * #define ISO15765_DCNCP_PROTOCOL_ID     0x02
 *
 * If a ISO15765 Message is received with a frist Byte of 0x01 then the message
 * is passed to the network logger functionality. Likewise 0x02 is passed to 
 * Layer 3 of DCNCP Handler.
 *
 * Unlike Layer 2 ISO15765, Layer 3, is an addressed protocol. Messages are 
 * sent from a node with a specific address across the network to a node 
 * with a destination address. Therefore a CAN Node using ISO15765 must have
 * a BYTE value defining the Layer 3 address of the node.
 *
 * The ISO15765 functionality in the es_lib code does not dictate how a Layer
 * 3 node address is obtained. If your project is including ISO15765 you will
 * have to add a function to the project which the library code can call to 
 * obtain it's layer 3 node address.
 *
 *     u8 node_get_address(void)
 *     {
 *             return(0x01);
 *     }
 *
 * The above example, whilst valid, is too simplistic to be used in producton.
 * Whilst the es_lib ISO15765 functionality will request a Layer 3 node address
 * from your higher level code a DCNCP peer to peer based protocol is used to 
 * confirm that the address is not already in use on the network. If the Layer
 * 3 node address you have specified is already in use your "node_get_address()
 * function will be recalled!
 *
 * The CAN Node OS stores the Layer 3 node address in EEPROM and uses that
 * address as its "first choice". If that address is rejected it sleects another
 * address at random and stores the new address in EEPROM:
 *  
 *     u8 node_get_address(void)
 *     {
 *             static u8 retry_count = 0;
 *	       result_t rc;
 *	       u8 address;
 *
 *	       if(retry_count == 0) {
 *		       rc = eeprom_read(EEPROM_NODE_ADDRESS, &address);
 *		       if (rc != SUCCESS) {
 *		               LOG_E("address Failed to read from eeprom return code 0x%x\n\r", rc);
 *			       do {
 *				       address = (u8) (rand() & 0x0ff);
 *			       } while (address == BROADCAST_NODE_ADDRESS);
 *
 *			       rc = eeprom_write(EEPROM_NODE_ADDRESS, address);
 *			       if (rc != SUCCESS) {
 *			       	       LOG_E("Failed to write from eeprom return code 0x%x\n\r", rc);
 *			       }
 *		       } else {
 *			       LOG_D("address value read back from EEPROM address 0x02 = 0x%x\n\r", address);
 *		       }
 *	       } else {
 *		       do {
 *			       address = (u8) (rand() & 0x0ff);
 *		       } while (address == BROADCAST_NODE_ADDRESS);
 *		
 *		       rc = eeprom_write(EEPROM_NODE_ADDRESS, address);
 *		       if (rc != SUCCESS) {
 *			       LOG_E("Failed to write from eeprom return code 0x%x\n\r", rc);
 *		       }
 *	       }
 *
 *	       retry_count++;
 *
 *	       LOG_D("node_get_address() Retry %d try address 0x%x\n\r", retry_count, address);
 *	       return(address);
 *     }
 *
 * The above node_get_address() function can be called multiple times by the
 * es_lib code until it finds an address which is not being used.
 *
 * If your network is your own private network and it only has limited nodes
 * then you can hardcode an address into each node on the network.
